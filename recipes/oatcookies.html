    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat to oven to 350 degrees. Line rimmed baking sheets with
            parchment paper and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl whisk together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon,
            and salt, until compltely mixed.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, with a hand held mixer or using a stand mixer,
            beat together the butter brown sugar, and granulated sugar until
            the mixture is light and fluffy. This will take between 3 and 6
            minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs one at a time. Then add in the vanilla. Be sure to
            scrape down the edges of the bowl with a spatula before each
            addition.</li>
        <li>Add in the flour mixture. With the mixer on it's lowest setting,
            beat the flour mixture into the wet ingredients until it just begins
            to combine. Then turn the mixture up and finish combinging it until
            it is just combined. Be careful not to continue mixing after the
            flour is combined in.</li>
        <li>Mix in the oats and then the raisins.</li>
        <li>Using a 1 1/2 tablespoon cookie scoop, scoop the cookies and roll
            them into balls. Place 2 1/2 inches apart on a baking sheet. Bake
            for 11 to 12 minutes or until the edges of the cookies begin to turn
            golden brown. For best results, rotate the pan half way through.
            Remove fro the oven, let cool on the baking sheet for two minutes,
            and then transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely.</li>
        <li>Enjoy right away or store in an airtight container for up to 1 week.</li>
