    <h3>Cookies that will melt in your mouth.</h3>
    <p>These are the chocolate chip cookies you will make for yourself on Sunday
        afternoon. That your kids will beg you for on Saturdays. That your friends
        will try to pry every detail of the recipe from you. They are perfectly chewy
        and moist.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter, (16 Tbsp), softened</li>
        <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup light brown sugar, tightly packed</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, room temperature</li>
        <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour, measured correctly</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking soda, sifted</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips, (12 oz), dividing
            1/4 cup for the top
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350˚ F. Line a baking sheet with parchment or
            Silpat liner. In the bowl of a stand mixer with paddle attachment,
            combine 2 sticks of butter, 1 cup of packed brown sugar and 1/2 cup
            of white sugar. Beat 5 minutes on medium/high speed until creamy and
            light, scraping down the bowl as needed.</li>
        <li>Add 2 eggs, one at a time, beating well with each addition, scraping
            down the bowl as needed, then beat in 2 tsp of vanilla.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, combine 3 cups of flour, 1 tsp salt, and 1
            tsp of baking soda (sifted to eliminate lumps). Add the flour mixture
            to the creamed butter in thirds, mixing to incorporate with
            each addition. Fold in 2 cups of chocolate chips.</li>
        <li>Use an ice cream scoop to get even balls of dough (3 Tbsp each).
            Place scoops of dough onto lined baking sheet about 2 inches apart.
            Mine fit onto 3 cookie sheets and made 26 cookies. Roll balls lightly
            with your hands then stud tops of cookie balls with reserved chocolate
            chips. Bake right away or cover and refrigerate until ready to bake.</li>
        <li>Bake one cookie sheet at a time for 12-15 min at 350˚F (we bake 12
            minutes), until edges are just turning golden. The tops should still
            look under-baked. Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet 5 min
            then transfer to a rack to cool. </li>
    </ol>
