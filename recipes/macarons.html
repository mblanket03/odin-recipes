    <h3>French and Fussy but Amazing</h3>
    <p>Simple ingredients, not simple to make. Macarons have a well-earned reputation
        for being difficult to make but when done right, they are worth the time and
        effort. Colors and flavors are endlessly variable.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>For the Macarons</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>70 grams almond flour, room temperature</li>
        <li>120 grams powdered sugar</li>
        <li>65 grams egg whites, room temperature</li>
        <li>50 grams granulated sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For the Filling</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Up to you!</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The best way to learn to make macarons is watch a hundred great
            bakers do and really take notes. Learn exactly what they do and how they
            do. Don't be discouraged if your first attempts are not perfect, theirs
            weren't either.
